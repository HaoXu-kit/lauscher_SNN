# jax-snn-guide
If you were looking for jaxsnn ("Jackson") by the fine folks from Heidelberg, please see here https://github.com/electronicvisions/jaxsnn.

This repository contains a collection of some JAX implementations for SNN models and learning rules.

Neuron models:
- Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) [ ] <link>
- adLIF [ ] <link>

Learning rules:
- Backpropagation-through-Time (BPTT) [ ] <link>
- e-prop [ ] <link>

*NOTE* if you want to run main.py you need to create a folder called "shd" and put in shd_train.h5 and shd_test.h5, which can be downloaded here https://zenkelab.org/datasets/
